# 👋 Hi, I’m Hoorvash  
*A curious builder blending code, creativity, and emotion.*

I’m a software engineer with a twist: I started in advertising tech and fintech, wrangled distributed systems, and recently leveled up with a master's in computer science from Memorial University of Newfoundland. But what really fuels me? **Using AI to make tech feel more human.**  

From building CT segmentation helpers with LLMs to generating music-driven dance movements with GenAI, I like to stand at the crossroads of **logic and imagination**. Whether it's automating a real-time ad engine or designing an agent that listens to your requests and genererate amazing reposnse, I love turning complex systems into experiences that *feel* something.
